## User Story
- As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.
  When I open the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
  When I view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 
  When I click into a time block, I can enter an event.
  When I click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
  When I refresh the page, the saved events persist.
